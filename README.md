# Excursion

This is my version of the Excursion Project for CodeCademy's Full Stack Engineer course.

The project is to recreate a small webpage advertising a new mobile app that will be available soon. This was recreated from a redline and inspect a live version of the page here: https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/index.html.
